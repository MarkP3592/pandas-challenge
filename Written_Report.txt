Summary:
First, I created a district summary that showed the number of schools, students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall (both math and reading).  Then, I calculated the same metrics for each individual school, and well how much each school spent per student.  I found the highest performing schools and lowest performing schools and broke down math and reading scores by grade.  I also found math and reading scores and passing rates based on spending per student and size of school.  Finally I found the math and reading scores, and passing rates based on school type.
Conclusions:
The first conclusion is that charter schools perform much better than district schools with a 90% overall passing rate compared to 53% for district schools.  Another interesting conclusion is that spending does not seem to have an impact on pass rates, with the best performing schools being those that spend in the bottom two buckets of spending per student.  Finally, the size of the school may have an impact on passing rates, as small and medium schools perform similarly while large schools perform significantly worse.
